## How does HDBSCAN work?
As highlighted by the missing gaps in [[Data Pipeline]], it's crucial that I understand HDBSCAN better as that is the main clustering algorithm I'll be working with (so far...). Concretely, I need to investigate: 
- Are there any statistical measurements of quality? (qva [[Explanatory models should statistically match base models]])
- How are the clusters defined with regards to centroids? 
- How does HDBSCAN compare to other algorithms (like LDA)
