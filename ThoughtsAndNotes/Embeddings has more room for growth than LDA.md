Language embeddings are rapidly evolving. They probably will keep evolving as a function of more compute, more data and smarter algorithms. This means that topics based on embeddings will also evolve with the backend (especially if we solve [[Explanatory models should statistically match base models]]). 

If the technique is feasible, embeddings are bound to overtake LDA (though 
[[LDA would be a good baseline for topic modelling]]).
