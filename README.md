# TransTopicXAI
Exploration of topic modelling for transformers ðŸ“šðŸ¤–

## What is this repo for? 
This repo is for exploration and thinking about my b.sc. thesis on creating end-user explainable semantic search using transformers. It will be include both code and notes+thoughts. 

### Why End-User Explainability?
Many AI-solutions ultimately end up as decision support for non-technical end users. While experts in their domain, these users might have very limited (if any) knowledge of SOTA machine learning algorithms. Therefore it is important to provide *intuitive* and *trustworthy* algorithms and interfaces. This project will probably mainly deal with the former but hopefully also attempt the later. 

## How is the repo structured? 
The structure of the repo is very much under development. However as of now it looks something like this: 

.
+-- src (where all the (very exploratory atm) scripts goes)
+-- ThoughtsAndNotes (an [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault with notes and thoughts regarding the project)

Any feedback is much appreciated! :))
